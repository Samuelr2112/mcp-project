# MCP Project  
**Checkpoint #2: CRUD working with FastAPI, PostgreSQL, and Claude**  

This repository marks the second checkpoint of my MCP project. At this stage, the backend API has been fully extended with CRUD functionality for managing appointments, and it now works seamlessly through Claude thanks to Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration.  

---

## ‚úÖ What I accomplished  

### Backend with FastAPI  
- Implemented a complete CRUD API for appointments:  
  - `POST /create_appointment` ‚Üí create a new appointment  
  - `GET /list_appointments` ‚Üí list all appointments  
  - `PUT /update_appointment/{id}` ‚Üí update an existing appointment  
  - `DELETE /delete_appointment/{id}` ‚Üí delete an appointment  
- Added flexible date parsing so the API accepts ISO 8601 date strings.  
- Ensured consistent output formatting for appointment dates.  

### Database with PostgreSQL  
- PostgreSQL container is fully set up via Docker Compose.  
- FastAPI correctly creates and persists appointment records.  
- Database is stable and works across container restarts.  

### MCP integration with Claude  
- Updated `manifest.json` so Claude understands required parameters (`customer_name`, `date`, `appointment_id`).  
- Verified that Claude can now:  
  - Create appointments by natural language prompts.  
  - List, update, and delete appointments with simple commands.  
- Tested natural language requests successfully (e.g., ‚ÄúAdd an appointment for Emily Gist on September 25th at 11:30 AM‚Äù).  

### Version control  
- All changes tracked in Git.  
- Checkpoint #2 commit includes CRUD logic, error handling, and integration with Claude.

## üî• Natural Language Examples  

### 1. Create appointment
**Generic prompt:**  
Create an appointment for **[customer_name]** on **[date in format yyyy-mm-ddTHH:MM:SS]**

**Example:**  
Create an appointment for **Pedro Martinez** on **2025-09-26T11:00:00**

---

### 2. Update appointment
**Generic prompt:**  
Update the appointment with ID **[appointment_id]** and change it to **[new_date in format yyyy-mm-ddTHH:MM:SS]**  
(Optional: also change the customer to **[new_customer_name]**)

**Example:**  
Update the appointment with ID **8** and change it to **2025-09-27T14:00:00**

---

### 3. List appointments
**Generic prompt:**  
Show me all appointments

**Example:**  
Show me all appointments

---

### 4. Delete appointment
**Generic prompt:**  
Delete the appointment with ID **[appointment_id]**

**Example:**  
Delete the appointment with ID **8**

---

## üåê Current Status  
- API runs locally at `http://localhost:8000`.  
- PostgreSQL container is connected and persists data.  
- MCP proxy integration allows Claude to call the API endpoints.  
- Natural language requests to Claude now create, list, update, and delete appointments successfully.  

---

## üöÄ Next Steps  
- Add validation for overlapping appointments.  
- Expand appointment details (duration, notes, contact info).  
- Write automated tests with pytest.  
- Build a simple frontend to manage appointments visually.  
- Continue refining Claude‚Äôs natural language integration with MCP.
